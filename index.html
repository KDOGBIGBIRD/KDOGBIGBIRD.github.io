    <h1>Gucci investigation</h1>
    
    <h3>By:KN</h3>
    <p>Why aren't Gucci employees treated fairly? I asked this question because different shipping companies may have worse but follow the law correctly no-matter the discrimination or disrespect they do to the workers they follow child labor laws and rights ect+.</p>
    <h2> Source 3and4</h2>
    <p>I got this information from sys.org c.ll.c.com and Wikipedia .
    </p>
    
    <h4>learned that different companies have different working conditions some good some bad. But it is wrong how employees are treated differently by their race discrimination and safety issues.</h4>
    <p> I feel this research is important because diffrent workers in factories world wide suffer from terrible working conditions dicrimination,horrible working enviorments, and we desirve to know the truth of wich these factories or clothing companyees (such as gucci) are really hiding</p>

    <p> Clothes using cotten as the material are 60 percent cotton but, the even more confusing fact most GUCCI products have 1 percent of cotton in them.</p>
    <p> I will continue to find more research about working conditions,cotton usage .ect.</p>
